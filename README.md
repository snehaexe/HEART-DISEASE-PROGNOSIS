# HEART-DISEASE-PROGNOSIS
This project is a predictive model on Machine Learning based on prediction of heart disease. It includes the model to have a supervised understanding of dataset and filter dataset using supervised algorithms available in python like logistic regression and random forest classifier.

## PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
Prognosis: predicting the course and treatment of a disease. Prognosis is done before diagnosis.

◼ As there are many heart conditions where it can be a risk to provide diagnosis at a later stage, hence an 
early detection of such disease is required. 
(EARLY AND ACCURATE PREDICTIVE MODEL)

◼ Intelligent computational predictive system is found the most effective way for identification and 
diagnosis of heart diseases. These computational intelligent models gives several distinct features and 
selective algorithms that could be applied to the input data to generate a predictive system which will 
help in accurate and effective heart disease detection.

## MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS
Within artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, there are two basic approaches: supervised learning and 
unsupervised learning.


### Supervised Learning :
Data Set -> An example data set is given to the algorithm.
This contains data that is already divided into
specific categories/clusters (labeled data).

Use Cases -> Well suited for making classifications, i.e.
dividing the data according to the given clusters.
Also, well suited for regression analysis, for
example, to make predictions about the
frequency of questions asked.

### Unsupervised Learning
Data Set -> The algorithm is given data that does not have a
previous classification (unlabeled data).

Use Cases -> Well suited for clustering. In this way, patterns
in data can be identified.
Also, suitable for association analysis, in order
to recognize which relationships exist among the
data.

## APPROACH 1 : LOGISTIC REGRESSION
Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to 
predict the probability of a target variable. The nature of target or dependent 
variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible 
classes.
In logistic regression, instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an "S" shaped 
logistic function, which predicts two maximum values (0 or 1).

## APPROACH 2 : RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER
Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on 
various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the 
predictive accuracy of that dataset. Instead of relying on one decision tree, 
the random forest takes the prediction from each tree and based on the 
majority votes of predictions, and it predicts the final output.
The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and 
prevents the problem of overfitting.
